CLASSIC ARCADE GAME
===================

## How The Game Works

In this game, you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the bugs. The player can move left, right, up and down using the keyboard arrow keys. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the canvas. Once the player hits a bug, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting position. The game is won once the player reaches the water.
